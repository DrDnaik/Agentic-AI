Here’s a simple, clear **text about fever**:

**Understanding Fever**

A **fever** is a temporary rise in body temperature, usually signaling that the body is fighting an infection or illness. The normal body temperature is around **98.6°F (37°C)**, but it can vary slightly from person to person. A fever generally begins when the body’s immune system identifies harmful invaders—such as viruses, bacteria, or other pathogens—and raises the internal temperature to help destroy them.

Fever is **not an illness by itself** but a **symptom**. Common causes include viral infections like the flu or common cold, bacterial infections, heat exhaustion, dehydration, or inflammation. Symptoms that often accompany fever include chills, sweating, headache, fatigue, and body aches.

Most fevers are mild and go away on their own as the body fights off the infection. Drinking plenty of fluids, resting, and staying cool often help. However, very high fevers or fevers that last too long may require medical attention, especially in children or individuals with other health conditions.

In general, fever is the body’s natural defense mechanism—a sign that your immune system is actively working to keep you healthy.

Artificial intelligence (AI) is the ability of machines to perform tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as learning, problem-solving, and decision-making. It works by processing vast amounts of data to identify patterns, which allows systems to analyze their environment, adapt, and act to achieve specific goals without direct human intervention. From revolutionizing healthcare with faster diagnostics to powering everyday tools like virtual assistants, AI's versatility makes it a transformative force reshaping industries and our daily lives.

Common Primary Headache Types

Tension Headaches: Usually cause a mild to moderate, dull ache or feeling like a tight band or vice around the head. They are often triggered by stress.


Migraine Headaches: Characterized by moderate to severe throbbing or pulsating pain, often on one side of the head. Migraines are a complex neurological condition and frequently come with other symptoms like nausea, vomiting, and extreme sensitivity to light (photophobia) and sound (phonophobia).


Cluster Headaches: Rare but extremely painful, characterized by severe stabbing or burning pain usually concentrated behind one eye. They occur in groups or "clusters" of attacks
